# Abstract

<!-- NEED TO UPDATE  -->

This blogpost explores suicide trends among youth (ages 10 - 24) in Florida between 2006 and 2017, examining the effects of race and gender. The post answers the following questions with respect to population in focus:  

> Q1 - What is the overall trajectory of youth suicides in FL between 2006 and 2017? 

> Q2 - What ages are most vulnerable to suicide? 

> Q3 - What are the most prevalent methods of youth suicide? 

> Q4 - How do trends compare across the methods of suicide?

> Q5 - How do trends compare by race, sex, and methods of suicide?

# Data  

The suicide data comes from [Florida Health Charts](http://www.flhealthcharts.com/charts/default.aspx) and contains suicide mortality between 2006 and 2017, broken down by suicide means, county, sex, age, and race. Additionally, we  use [Bridged-Race Population Estimates](https://wonder.cdc.gov/bridged-race-population.html) to help with age-specific rate calculations.  


The groomed data sets are available for download: [FL Suicides][ds1] and [FL Population Estimates][ds2].  

[ds1]:https://github.com/dss-hmi/suicide-prevention-2019/blob/d72ee51834ab48ab84547e20a6109a13aa88d2a2/data-public/derived/9-population-suicide.rds
[ds2]:https://github.com/dss-hmi/suicide-prevention-2019/blob/d72ee51834ab48ab84547e20a6109a13aa88d2a2/data-public/derived/9-population-suicide-2.rds

```{r load-data, echo=echoChunks, results='hide', message=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
```

```{r tweak-data-1, echo=echoChunks, results='hide', message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
```


The observation unit is defined by the first 6 variables: `county`, `year`, `sex`, `race`, `ethnicity`, `age_group`. For each unit, there are two measures: the number of people (`n_population`) and the number of observed suicide events (`n_suicides`). The latter is broken down by  means of suicide. 

```{r inspect-data-1, echo=TRUE, echo=echoChunks, results='show', message=FALSE, cache = TRUE}
```

Another data set, `ds2`, augmented with CDC population estimates, has very similar structure, but differs from `ds1` in three respects:   

1. Instead of `age_group` it features `age`, measured in whole years, providing higher resolution    

2. Mortality cause is grouped into two categories `fireamrs` and `other`, as opposed to a more granular, 7-category classification of mortality cause in `ds1`  

3. Covers years `2000-2018` as opposed to `2006-2018` in `ds1`

#### Summary of differences in data sets used in the report: 

| data set | suicide means | age resolution | years covered|
|---|---|---|---|
|`ds1`| 7 | age group | 2006 - 2017|
|`ds2`| 2 | 1 year | 2000 - 2018|

These differences arose from certain limitations in data procurement. We use `ds2` to explore age difference with higher resolution, at the expense of reducing resolution in mortality cause. 

The combined variable `race_ethinicity` is the product of the two respective components and was made to be idendical in both data sets:  
```{r}
ds1 %>% distinct(race, ethnicity, race_ethnicity) 
all.equal(
ds1 %>% distinct(race, ethnicity, race_ethnicity) ,
ds2 %>% distinct(race, ethnicity, race_ethnicity) 
)
```

# Q1 - Overall Trend

To begin, let us answer the most fundamental question: 

> Q1 - What is the overall trajectory of youth suicides in FL between 2006 and 2017? 

To aid interpretation we have created an additional metric `1 out of`, which is a direct inverse of `Rate per 100K`, but offers a different perspective on the magnitude of the estimate. The numerical value of this metric answer the question __"One in how many individuals commit suicide?"__

```{r q1-1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=6, fig.width=9, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

The number of youth suicides increased by `98` cases, rising from `203` in 2006 to `301` in 2017, constituting a `r scales::percent((301-203)/301)` growth. If in `2006` one out every `17.5` thousands committed suicide, in `2017` one out of every `12` thousand individuals between age `10` and `24` took their own life. The demographic growth does not explain the increased number of suicide cases: the rate per `100,000` increased by `r scales::percent((8.34-5.74)/5.74)` from `5.74` to `8.34`.

Given these general trends for the entire `10 - 24` group, we would like to understand how  trends in population growth, suicide count and suicide rate compare among age group:

```{r q1-2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

The `10-14` age group exhibits quite a dramatic decrease in the `One out of` measure, dwarfing the scale for the other two age groups. We recreate it separately:

```{r q1-3, echo=TRUE, fig.height=3, fig.width=8, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

Demographic changes deserved to be examined seperately: 

```{r q1-4, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```
Note the sharp change in population count from `2011` to `2013`. The `15-19` group dropped, while the `20-24` group grew quite dramatically.  A closer examination, shows that while this demographic growth was present in all racial groups, it was particularly pronounced among  `Non-white + Non-Hispanic` youth. One possible explanation could be attributed to cohort effect: disproportionate amount of those in `15-19` group transitioned to `20-24` group during these years, but were not matched by the similar number of `10-14`year old transitioning into `15-19` group. Another possible explanation could reside in migration patterns. 


# Q2 - Suicide across lifespan

> Q2 - What ages are most vulnerable to suicide?  

To explore whether certain age transitions are associated with increased suicidality, we plot the distribution of suicide events within each year of age among the observed years (2006 - 2018). 
```{r q2-1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
```

There appears to be two plateaux across the lifespan, each preceeded by sharp increase: the first from ages `25` to `40` and another from ages `45` to `60`, after which the frequency of suicide declines monotonically. 

We see a marked spike in deaths during the 17 to 18 transition. 
It appears the majority of deaths in 10-14 groups could be attributed to 13 and 14 year olds (vertial dashed line). The plateau following the age 25 makes theoretical sense: after the turmoils of coming out of age and young adulthood, there life acquires a more stable character.
```{r q2-2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```
Also note, that when examining the trends within the `10-24` age group, the relationship between the age and the suicide mortality is very well summarized by a linear model ($R^2 = .85$): 
```{r q2-3, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

# Q3 - Prevalent Methods

> Q3 - What are the most prevalent methods of youth suicide? 

Florida Health Charts captures the causes of suicide mortality using `7` categories. We examine the raw event count and rates per `100,000` rates in the following two graphs:

```{r q3-1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

Notice that two methods `gun` and `hanging` consistently explain the most cases of suicide in this age group. Going further, we will collapse the other `5` categories into a single `non-gun/hang`, so that we have sufficient `n` to compute reliable rates. 

```{r q3-2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```




# Q4 - Methods across Years 


> Q4 - How do trends compare across the methds of suicide?

```{r q4-1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

When ignoring race and ethnicity, the average increase in the annual rate of suicide mortality from gun (+0.0996) is `r round(.0996/.0672,1)` times higher than that from Hanging (+.0672) and `r round(.0996/.0377,1)` times higher than other means (+.0377). Notice also, that mortality from firearms and hanging follow the trajectory closely described by a linear trend: $R^2$ = .7 and $R^2$ = .64, respectively. 

```{r q4-2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=5, fig.width=10, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```




# Q5 - Sex and Ethnicity

> Q5 - How do trends compare by race, sex, and means of means of suicide?

```{r q5-1, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=11, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```

The most prominent increase, dwarfing others, is observed among White Non-Hispanic men, rising from `r (r1 <- d10 %>% filter(race_ethnicity=="White + Non-Hispanic", year == 2006, sex=="Male", suicide_cause=="Gun") %>% pull(rate_suicides)); r1 %>% scales::number(accuracy=.1) ` in 2006 to `r (r2 <- d10 %>% filter(race_ethnicity=="White + Non-Hispanic", year == 2017, sex=="Male", suicide_cause=="Gun") %>% pull(rate_suicides)); r2 %>% scales::number(accuracy=.1)` in 2017, constituting a `r scales::percent((r2-r1)/r1)` growth. Between these years, the rate per 100,000 in this category was increasing on average by `.33` per year. 

Among white women of both Hispanic and Non-Hispanic origin, this growth was substantially smaller, about `+.06` per year, similar to the growth in the rate of suicide by means other than firearms or hanging. However, suicides by hanging was increasing by `+.09` per year.

For Non-White Non-Hispanic women, the largest growth in suicide rates was observed from hanging (`+.1`), while suicides by other means barely increased.  

```{r q5-2, echo=TRUE, fig.height=7, fig.width=12, out.width = "900px", message=FALSE, results='show',cache=TRUE}
```
